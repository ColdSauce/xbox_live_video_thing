## heres a thing i wrote while my parents were watching the sopranos
# but i had already seen the episode they were watching so i was just
## kind of dicking around on my laptop and i started looking at the 
game clip viewer on xbox.com and i wrote this script that would download
## random clips that come from people saying "xbox, record that" and i
# watched it for a while and it was kind of hypnotizing and relaxing but
## then it would get really weird because you'd see some really brutal kill
in like mortal kombat or something or youd see someones body get all
## glitched up ina s ports game it was kind of off putting but itll all be
over in 30 seconds because thats how long the clips are so u just gotta
# soldier through it and get to the next one i know u can do it
